Hello, I am Chon Hei Lo, or call me Season! I am a senior student majoring in physics at Peking University. I come from Macau and I am also a cantonese speaker. As a physics student, I am quite interested at the microscopic things. I like coding and vistualizing what I can not see and what I can not touch. I enjoy observating the atoms move randomly, combine together, as well as form some meaningful structures by doing simulations. Besides, I do machine learning. I reproduced lots of models and modified them. I may not totally understand how all neural networks work, but I know how they 'not work'.


Research Interest
======
My research interests include appling neural networks into real data. Using them to produce valuable results. Also, I am so keen on optimizing some existed machine learning algorithm, namely making the code run as fast as C program, designing differentiable operators, and GPU-accelerated algorithm.
Besides, I am looking forward to exploring some simulation methods including Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Density Functional Theory (DFT).
