Hello, I am Chon Hei Lo! I'm a senior physics student at Peking University, originally from Macau and a native Cantonese speaker. Currently, I'm involved in undergraduate research on interfacial water systems under the supervision of Prof. [Limei Xu](https://icqm.pku.edu.cn/rydw/jzyg/236918.htm). In the summer of 2023, I had the oppor-tunity to intern at UPenn and Yale University under the supervision of Prof. [Lu Lu](https://lugroup.yale.edu), where I gained valuable experience in Scientific machine learning. [More about my research](research/)

My academic pursuits are deeply rooted in the microscopic world. I enjoy coding and visualizing the unseen - observing atoms in motion, combining, and forming meaningful structures through simulations. Besides physics, I delve into machine learning, where I have replicated and adapted various models. While I'm still exploring the full depth of neural networks, my journey so far has equipped me with a keen understanding of their functionalities and potential applications.

Research Interest
