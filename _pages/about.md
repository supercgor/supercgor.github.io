Hello, I am Chon-Hei Lo. I graduated from School of Physics, Peking Univesity in 2024. I am now working as a research assistant in ICQM, Peking university. My current research focuses on interfacial water systems, under the guidance of Prof. [Limei Xu](https://xulm.pku.edu.cn/index.htm). During the summer of 2023, I interned at the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked under Prof. [Lu Lu](https://lugroup.yale.edu), gaining hands-on experience in Scientific Machine Learning. If you are interested about my research, please [CLICK ME](research/) to learn more.

My academic interests are deeply rooted in exploring the microscopic world. I have a passion for coding and visualizing the invisible â€“ simulating atoms in motion, observing how they interact and form complex structures. I am keen on developing high-performance algorithms using pure Python with JIT compilation. I also have experience in using simulation software LAMMPS, and have developed a range of tools to analyze and visualize the data they produce.

Research Interest
